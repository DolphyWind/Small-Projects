Hello! I am olus2000 and I wrote this entry. So please make your guesses with that in mind. You don't believe me? 
But why wouldn't you believe me? Have I lied to you before? Please, just drag my name to the appropriate place.
You wouldn't wanna see me sad would you? What? You still don't believe me? Why even is that? You wanna be sure?
Fine... My full name is Aleksander Sabak. I studied computer science in Warsaw University of Technology. I love
Pico8, esolangs and concatanative programming. Umm... Oh yeah and also toki pona. Umm... Uhh... I... am also from
Poland. You probably know it already, but I just wanted to point it out. You believe me now right? Right? I swear,
I am not impersonating him... This entry really does belong to me. And by me, I mean olus2000. Because you know,
I am him, and he is me and I submitted this entry. Fuck, the last sentence was a spagetti.
