# Code Guessing \#57: Make an AI

Today's challenge is **Make an AI**. Submissions can be made in **any language**.

Hey you... Yes, you. Stop looking around, I am talking to you (you are alone in your room anyway). Before deciding to skip this round, read this specification first.
For this round of code guessing, your challenge is to make an AI. But don't worry, I don't expect you to make the next ChatGPT. You can make a bot for a game, train
a neural network or build the GladOS. AI's definition is pretty loose, so you have a lot of options laid in front of you. Any language is allowed, although I wanted
to ban rust just to troll Proloy. But I don't find it fair to do that to everybody just to troll one person.
